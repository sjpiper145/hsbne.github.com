## Meeting Notes

- Robot Fighting League Event:  Event on Saturday, see facebook events.  
- How to Vector Class:  See facebook events
- Upcoming Silversmithing classes:  Course will run over four lessons where skills from previous lessons will be built upon.  Classes to begin in late April.  
- Supanova Update:  See thread here.  
- Assistance with Flyer distribution: Our flyers have been printed and any member distribution of flyers is much appreciated.  
- Denial of access for unpaid members update:  We are currently setting up systems to disallow access for unpaid members due to repetitive unpaid membership invoices for active members. 
- Containers, Blacksmithing area update:  The boneyard container will join the other two containers for placement out on the hardstand.  An awning will be strung accross these containers to acccommodate the blacksmithing area. 
- Purchase Proposal: 23 cartridges of ink for $140.003 for the new large HP printer:  Unanimously passed, one abstaining.  
- AGM Upcoming: If you are interested in having a hand in how things work at HSBNE, have a chat to the current executive about the roles and what they entail.
